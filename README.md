A simple game of Rock, Paper, Scissors in c++


I just wanted to practice some basics of C++ so I decided to create this simple game of Rock, Paper, Scissors.

It utilizes while loops, do-while loops, switch statements, and if-else statements. It also uses pseudo-random number generation, as well as simple input and output (this was just to practice coding in C++ without the use of 'using namespace std')

# What does it do?
It simulates a game of Rock, Paper, Scissors by taking input from a user, and generating 'input' for the computer player (cpu).

Currently it just requests you input the type of match you'd like to play, Best of 1, 3, or 5, then it takes your inputs for rock, paper, or scissors, outputs the cpu vs player choices, and then updates the score. First to win the 'Best of' wins the game. Simple.
